# Switch

Switching Selector.
Design based on AntDesign.

## When To Use

If you need to represent the switching between two states or on-off state.

The difference between Switch and Checkbox is that Switch will trigger a state change directly when you toggle it, while Checkbox is generally used for state marking, which should work in conjunction with submit operation.
